The fifth win in 11 matches mean Mohammedan remain glued on the third position with 22 points, just two ahead of fourth-place Muktijoddha Sangsad, who easily sailed over Team BJMC with a 4-2 win in the day's first match. Sheikh Jamal DC and Abahani are in the first and second position respectively with 27 and 20 points from 11 matches each. However, Independence Cup champions Mohammedan found them hard against Uttar Baridhara Club, who had held them to a goalless draw in the first-leg match and the bottom-side of the table were about to hold their mighty opponents again before substitute Wahed tapped in a low cross from left-back Arup Kumar in the 90th minute to extend their winning runs to nine in which five wins came in the recently concluded Independence Cup. Before scoring the winning goal under the floodlight, Mohammedan did everything and could have killed off the game had debutant Portuguese striker Hardy Pinto was not denied twice by the woodworks. In the day's first match, the proceeding of the game indicated a fighting match between two mid-table sides as they both displayed attacking football till 23rd minute when Muktijoddha made the game one-sided to toy with BJMC, who have been suffering from lack of adequate training facilities following some internal problems. BJMC looked a bit of tiring at first but the All Reds did not mistake to grasp the opportunity with both hands going ahead in the 23rd minute with a strike from Nigerian Nkowcha Kingsley, who drove a rebounder from close after a free-kick from Sunday Chizoba was parried by BJMC goalkeeper Arif Hossain.   Nkowcha's partner Eleta Kingsley doubled the lead with an eye-catching left-footer inside the box on the stroke of the break. Muktijoddha Sangsad kept their dominance over BJMC after widening the margin to 3-0 six minutes into the second half with Nkowcha beating goalkeeper Ariful with a left-footer.    BJMC pulled one goal back through Nigerian Samson Iliasu with a long-rang shot on 58 minutes but Muktijoddha Sangsad took the match far away from them after scoring the fourth in the 61st minute when Sunday Chizoba found the back of the net inside the box. Ismael Bangoura converted a penalty kick to reduce the margin in the dying minute but the top-scorer of last season could not avert BJMC's second successive defeat in the league.

The Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) opened the Dhanmondi-8 playground to the general public yesterday. The development was marked by a signboard on the entrance gate of the playground -- so far used as the private property of Sheikh Jamal Dhanmondi Club -- proclaiming the field open to the general public. Celebrations followed the development in the residential area -- children would finally be able to avail the open space after being denied of that right for more than a year. However, the question remains how long it will take the authorities concerned to fully comply with a High Court order in 2011 which stated that the ground be freed from illegal occupancy for public access. Unfortunately, in the years following the HC verdict half a dozen government bodies including the DCC and public works department not only brazenly defied it but also favoured the private club -- named after the Prime Minister's slain brother -- that has been illegally occupying the field with several structures. The public works secretary, undivided Dhaka City Corporation, Rajdhani Unnyan Kartripakkha (Rajuk), Inspector General of Police, officer-in-charge of Dhanmondi police station were the parties at fault. Not only that, money was spent from the public treasury to fund the illegal occupation. In clear violation of court directions, the cash-crunched Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) last year funded a 1-crore taka boundary wall with ceramic brick and metal frames around the playground and a palatial entrance engraved with the club's name to directly facilitate the club's exclusive occupancy, said Mubasshar Hussain, a leading architect and resident of the area. So entrenched were the occupiers in their law-ignoring ways that the club president Manjur Kader, during a meeting at the playground on April 19, audaciously announced that the playground is only for 'elites' and not for any 'street urchins'. Taking full advantage of government support, the club tightened its grip further on the playground as an exclusive private property with round-the-clock security guards barring access to the general public for over a year now, said Hussain, who has been fighting a legal battle for this public space since 2004. Meanwhile, local government ministry at the end of last year, granted a block allocation of Tk 1.63 crore in favour of Sheikh Jamal Club to build two lawn tennis courts with floodlights, two badminton courts and a basketball court, altering the existing greenery and triggering a series of public protests over the past several weeks.   Abdul Gaffar, a former footballer and in-charge of implementing the club's ongoing development schemes, said, “Access to these facilities will be exclusive and the local people and school children will have to pay to enjoy those.” Local Government Engineering Division (LGED) was building the said courts without mandatory approval from Rajuk, said officials.     LGED chief engineer Wahidur Rahman said at the time, “It is not our mandate to do such work, but we are working on the dictates of the local government ministry, as Sheikh Jamal Club sought engineering support.”     Local Government Division secretary Manzur Hossain said: “I do not know about financing the club but I will look into how it happened.”      Official sources however said that immediate predecessor Abu Alam Shahid Khan allocated the money from the minister's special fund meant for DSCC at the fag end of his tenure.       When asked about compliance with the HC order to free the playground, DSCC chief executive officer Ansar Ali Khan said: “We are trying but could not due to different difficulties.” He declined to elaborate. Former Rajuk chairman Nurul Huda said, “We did not go for eviction of illegal structures as the club used the space as a playfield.”    Public Works Department (PWD) is the owner of the13.5-bigha playground that was handed over to City Corporation in 1984 for maintenance and conservation. Public works secretary Md. Golam Rabbani said that PWD chief engineer Kabir Ahmed Bhuiyan would be able to respond as to what his ministry has done to free the playground.    But Bhuiyan did not respond despite repeated phone calls and messages sent to his mobile phone. Dhaka Metropolitan Police Commissioner Benazir Ahmed chairs the club's governing body and frequents the illegally-built club office in the playground, said Mubasshar, who lives nearby. When contacted for his version on his role as the club's governing body chairman, the commissioner assigned one of his deputies to respond to The Daily Star. The deputy however said he would have to communicate with the commissioner to respond but did not come back with any response. While yesterday's action signals a victory for the residents after a protracted battle for their rights in the grounds' numerous illegal structures lies the threat that years of lawless occupation may yet continue to haunt.

With the scorching heat kept at bay by the closed windows of the air-conditioned room, the country's leading cricketers assembled to listen to a lecture not from a cricketing expert but a psychological skill development coach named Ali Khan, a Bangladeshi Canadian. One might say that the time would have been better spent doing some work in these trying conditions, but mental strength in modern sport is as vital as skill and fitness, especially when players have to confront pressure-filled situations. That is why many officials of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) felt the need of some assistance from an expert like Ali after national cricketers, including the tough Shakib Al Hasan, pointed to pressure as a reason for the team's recent dismal performances. Left-handed opener Tamim Iqbal was particularly interested in Ali's advice so that he can recover from his prolonged lean patch. The opener was not present at yesterday's first group session at the National Cricket Academy, where a total of 32 cricketers took part, but before going abroad he had more than 30 hours of discussions in six days with Ali Khan. Other cricketers also showed immense interest for one-to-one sessions with the psychological skill development coach after a long session where Ali mostly talked to give an idea about mental strength. “I think it's a very good idea. The first session was very encouraging and personally I felt that it will help us a lot. And I will keep in touch with him, so I can overcome a few things. It depends on you how you respond to it,” said Bangladesh skipper Mushfiqur Rahim. The extent of a three-day workshop's impact may be questioned. “Maybe not. The first job is to educate and then the second job is to achieve. We started the first bit and the board will definitely think about its continuation and someone may continue it. I have lot of commitments in Canada but I still have passion for my country,” said Ali. The BCB however has no clear idea about what they want to do with the programme and they did not sign any deal with Ali and it was also not sure whether the Bangladeshi expatriate will be paid for the sessions. “Let's see what happens with the players after the three-day programme. We are still not sure whether we will make any deal with him (Ali Khan). We will take the feedback from the players and also discuss the matter in the board,” said an unsure Akram Khan, BCB's cricket operations committee chairman.

The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has floated a tender for worldwide media rights for six years until 2020; potentially a major source of income for the country's richest sports body. The board was yet to disclose the detailed schedule of home matches during the six-year period but the parties will get the list when they buy tenders from April 27 till May 8. BCB however invited the tenders under the projections of 25-30 Tests, 40-45 ODIs and 10-15 T20 Internationals and was looking for a lucrative deal with the assurance of the commercially attractive India team's visit in 2014, 2015 and 2020. They had however failed in their first attempt to make a long-term deal two years ago following a poor response. Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, South Africa and Australia are also scheduled to visit during this period. “We are very much hopeful this time. We will definitely be more careful about the deal considering our previous bitter experience. This time we are not interested to include the live telecast of some domestic matches in this new deal because of what happened in the past,” said Kazi Inam Ahmed, chairman of BCB's marketing and commercial committee. There will be an open auction on May 12. “This time a clause ensured that Bangladeshi TV channels will be able to apply. Broadcasters with a year's experience in the business can also apply,” said Inam. The last such long-term deal with Nimbus lasted till early 2012 but the experience for BCB was a bitter one.

Real Madrid took a huge step towards their first Champions League final in 12 years as Karim Benzema's first-half goal gave them a 1-0 first-leg lead over holders Bayern Munich at the Santiago Bernabeu. The Frenchman was on hand to turn home Fabio Coentrao's cross on 19 minutes and Madrid's advantage could have been even greater had Cristiano Ronaldo and Angel di Maria not missed fine chances before the break. Bayern had the overwhelming majority of possession but failed to convert it into many sights of goal as Iker Casillas' low save from Mario Goetze five minutes from time was the only significant stop the Spanish captain was forced into all evening. Defeat leaves the Germans with it all to do next Tuesday, April 29, if they are to continue their quest to become the first side to retain the trophy in the Champions League era. Ronaldo was returning after four games out with a hamstring injury as he replaced Gareth Bale, who had been suffering from flu in the days before the game, in the only change from the Real side that beat Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final last week. However, it was Bayern who settled first as they pinged the ball around for the opening 15 minutes, but Arjen Robben's shot from the edge of the area that was deflected wide was their only serious effort on goal. Madrid then stung the Germans with a stunning counter-attack as Ronaldo's ball down the left for Coentrao was timed to perfection and the Portuguese full-back's low cross was tapped home at the back post by Benzema. Two minutes later Ronaldo came close to doubling Madrid's lead, but his bullet header from Di Maria's cross was too close to Manuel Neuer. Ronaldo then missed a gilt-edged chance to make it 2-0 when another quick break caught Bayern hopping and the World Player of the Year blasted over Benzema's low cross from close range. Bayern were still enjoying the vast majority of the ball without cutting the Madrid defence open as Robben saw another goal-bound effort blocked before Philipp Lahm shot into the side-netting from a narrow angle. Indeed Madrid should even have been further ahead at the break when Di Maria latched onto a deep cross at the back post but wastefully volleyed over with just Neuer to beat. The German international 'keeper was forced to make a save just two minutes after half-time when he diverted Ronaldo's low shot across goal to safety. Both sides then made a raft of substitutions as the game entered the final quarter with Bale replacing the clearly not 100 percent fit Ronaldo 16 minutes from time. Raphael Varane also replaced the injured Pepe for Los Blancos, whilst Bayern coach Pep Guardiola introduced Javi Martinez, Mario Goetze and Thomas Mueller in the search for an away goal. And it was two of the substitutes who combined to create the visitors' best chance of the night as Mueller's dinked cross found Goetze free inside the area and his low drive was brilliantly saved by Iker Casillas. There was one final moment of controversy deep into stoppage time as Mueller tumbled under a challenge from Xabi Alonso inside the area, but English referee Howard Webb waved away the protests for a penalty to condemn Bayern to a third defeat in six games in all competitions.

Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola said his side had struggled to contain Real Madrid's pace on the counter-attack as Los Blancos secured a 1-0 advantage from the first leg of their Champions League semifinal on Wednesday. Karim Benzema scored the only goal of the game on 19 minutes from one of a series of Madrid counter-attacks in the first-half that caught the European champions wanting at the back. "Madrid have athletes. They are footballers, but they are real athletes," said the former Barcelona boss after suffering his first defeat in eight games as a coach at the Santiago Bernabeu. "It is easy to say we need to play more vertically, but the quicker we move the ball forward, the quicker it comes back and that can be very dangerous for us." Bayern enjoyed 63 percent of the possession, but failed to create many clear-cut opportunities as Madrid defended in numbers. And Guardiola expects more of the same when his side try to turn the tie around on home soil at the Allianz Arena on Tuesday. "I think the next game will be exactly the same. We need to control their counter-attacks, but it is a question of finding the right balance. "Madrid are a complete team and it is true that not scoring away from home makes the tie very difficult. "However, we will be at home, with our fans behind us, and we will give everything to reach the final." Real boss Carlo Ancelotti admitted he didn't like having to relinquish control of the ball for large spells to the Germans. However, just as in Madrid's Copa del Rey victory over Barcelona last week, the Italian believed his side had played to their strengths. "I don't like to give up the ball. It is clear that you cannot control the ball for the whole game, but especially against Barca and Bayern it is very difficult to control it. "Football, though, is not just about possession, but defending, counter-attacks and many other things. What we had tonight was the sacrifice of the players, but I don't like not having the ball because you have less chance to score." Ancelotti had recalled World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo to his starting line-up after four games out through injury. The Portuguese was involved in the build up to the goal and had another glaring opportunity to make it 2-0 when he blasted over soon after before being replaced by Gareth Bale with 20 minutes remaining. Ancelotti admitted Ronaldo's withdrawal had been a pre-meditated measure to ensure he didn't run the risk of aggravating the injury, but expects both he and Bale -- who had been suffering from flu before the game -- to be 100 percent fit for the return leg. "It was a decision that we took before the game because the only risk with Cristiano would come once the muscle got tired. "It is normal that after 20 days he is not 100 percent but he sacrificed himself for the team and both Cristiano and Bale will be in perfect condition for Tuesday."

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, assistant Rui Faria and midfielder Ramires have been charged over their behaviour during their side's loss to Sunderland last weekend, the Football Association announced on Wednesday. Mourinho mocked match referee Mike Dean after the game, which Sunderland won 2-1 through an 82nd-minute Fabio Borini penalty to condemn the Portuguese to his first ever home league defeat as Chelsea manager. Faria was sent to the stands for angrily confronting the match officials, while Ramires appeared to strike Sunderland midfielder Sebastian Larsson in an off-the-ball incident during the first half. "Jose Mourinho has been charged with misconduct in respect of post-match comments he made following the fixture," read a statement on the FA website. "It is alleged that Mourinho's comments constitute improper conduct, in that they call into question the integrity of the referee appointed to the above fixture and/or the integrity of Mr Mike Riley, General Manager of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited, and/or the comments bring the game into disrepute." Dean's decision to award Sunderland a penalty after Cesar Azpilicueta slid in on Jozy Altidore prompted a furious reaction in the home dug-out, with Faria having to be restrained by Mourinho as he shouted at the referee. Faria has been charged with two counts of misconduct, with the FA designating his case "a non-standard case due to the aggressive and/or threatening and/or serious nature of the reported behaviour".

Argentina must create the right team climate to give the world's best player Lionel Messi the right support to enable him to shine at the World Cup in Brazil, coach Alejandro Sabella said on Wednesday. Sabella also said Argentina's status among the favourites would be countered by the fact they will be playing in the backyard of the most successful team in the competition with five titles. Messi has had a troubled few months and been the butt of criticism for Barcelona's drop in form, including their Champions League quarterfinal elimination and slipping four points off the pace in La Liga. "Messi is fine but we must try to be the best possible team to help him," Sabella said. "We have to get the team to be more compact, occupy the spaces," he said in an interview with news agencies at the Argentine FA's training complex on the outskirts of the capital. "Messi has matured as a person, he has interior peace, but we have to create a climate that will allow him to be happy, I think we have to let him be calm," the 59-year-old said. "He's already played at the World Cup, he didn't score goals but he created many chances, only there were goalkeepers who had brilliant afternoons," Sabella added, referring to the 2010 tournament in South Africa. Messi has played at two World Cups having made his debut at in Germany as a teenager in 2006 and scoring one goal. At both tournaments, Argentina went out to Germany in the quarter-finals. "The objective we need to aim for is to be in the last four where Argentina have not been for some time," Sabella said. Twice champions Argentina last played in the semifinals in 1990 in Italy. "We must go step by step, getting there is not easy and in the last 16 or quarterfinals you can get more complicated opponents, you can have a bad day and those teams can send you home," he said. "Generally, Argentina have gone to the World Cup with an aura (of favourites), there's the passion, the desire and forecast that they could be world champions, I think it's always been like that," Sabella said. "This time a bit more so because Messi's has been in his splendour in the national team and because we're playing in our neighbour's backyard and can almost feel like we're at home. "But what happens with that backyard is that it belongs to the biggest winners of World Cups, the five-times champions and we're going to be more like visitors than ever," added Sabella, whose greatest moment as a coach was when his Estudiantes team won the South American Libertadores Cup final in Brazil in 2009. Sabella had a scare when one of his leading players, Fernando Gago, was injured playing for Boca Juniors last week but he said he was confident the midfielder would be fit for the tournament starting on June 12. "He's coming here for his medical check-ups, he looks okay to me, he won't have problems (getting to Brazil). It's probable he'll be short of football because of a period out of action and due to a lack of full movement of his knee," Sabella said. Sabella considers Gago to be Messi's ideal ball provider on the right side of midfield. His understudies are Lazio's Lucas Biglia and Ever Banega of Newell's Old Boys. Argentina meet Bosnia in Rio de Janeiro in their opening Group F match on June 15. They also face Iran and Nigeria.

Bangladesh's top golfer Siddikur Rahman endured a horrid start to the CIMB Niaga Indonesian Masters with a round of four-over-par 76 at the Royale Jakarta Golf Club yesterday. The poor round, which saw Siddikur trade six bogeys for two birdies, had him languishing in joint-109th position. Meanwhile, Malaysia's Nicholas Fung had a dazzling round of five-under-par 67 and shared the first-round lead with Korean-American Antony Kang. A host of golfers -- Chapchai Nirat and Jazz Janewattananond of Thailand, Cameron Smith and Jake Higginbottom of Australia, Bernd Wiesberger of Austria and India's Sujjan Singh -- were locked in the third place with four-under-par 68s.
