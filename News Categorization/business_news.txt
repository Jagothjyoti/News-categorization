The Finance Division early this week sent the proposal to the planning ministry. The planning ministry has been asked to prepare the next ADP within Tk 79,031 crore against the Tk 60,000 crore revised ADP for the current fiscal year. In the next fiscal year, the Bridges Division has been given the third highest allocation among 71 ministries and divisions. The Bridges Division has only two projects -- Padma bridge got Tk 8,100 crore and Dhaka elevated expressway project Tk 635 crore. In the Tk 8,100 crore set aside for the Padma bridge, Tk 1,600 crore is Indian grant. In the current fiscal year's allocation, the Padma bridge, as a single project, got the highest allocation of Tk 6,852 crore; but as work on various components did not progress as per plans, Tk 2,042 crore has been kept for the project in the revised ADP. However, officials have expressed doubt whether the revised allocation could be utilised as only Tk 414 crore was spent in nine months of the current fiscal year. But a Bridges Division official said work orders for three main components of the Padma bridge project, including the main bridge construction and river training, will be awarded in the next fiscal year. So the proposed allocation will be required, he added. The allocation that the Finance Division gave for the next fiscal year includes ADP's local fund that has been increased by around 33 percent from the revised budget to make the allocation Tk 51,331 crore. Meanwhile, the allocation for foreign funds has been raised by 32 percent, over the revised budget, to Tk 27,700 crore. In the proposed allocation for the next fiscal year's ADP, Tk 1,506 crore has been given as a 'block allocation' so that the National Economic Council (NEC) can accommodate the additional demand of the ministries, a Finance Division official said. In the proposed allocation, the highest sum of money, or Tk 13,017 crore, went to the Local Government Division, and the second highest of Tk 9,273 crore to the Power Division. Besides, the primary and mass education ministry got Tk 5,578 crore, the education ministry Tk 3,422 crore, Roads Division Tk 4,287 crore and the railways ministry Tk 4,085 crore. A planning ministry official said the demands they got from different ministries and divisions for the next fiscal year are much higher than the funds allocated by the Finance Division. The official said they will now prepare the next fiscal year's ADP within the allocated funds and the NEC will decide on the demands for additional funds.

The state minister for foreign affairs, on the occasion of the anniversary of Rana Plaza collapse, yesterday urged the garment sector stakeholders not to do business in a way that it endangers people's lives. “Today we should commit that we will not do business which kills people. Personally, I made a commitment today that I will not do such a business which will kill people,” Shahriar Alam, state minister for foreign affairs, said. His comments came at an event organised by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association at its headquarters to commemorate the first anniversary of the industrial accident, the worst in the garment industry. The programme was attended by the dead workers' children and survivors, trade union leaders, ministers and garment owners. Commerce Minister Tofail Ahmed said he could never imagine an incident as tragic as the collapse of the eight-storey building in Bangladesh. “Let us learn some lessons from this dark chapter in our history.” “I do not want another tragedy like the Rana Plaza building collapse. I cannot even sleep when I remember the incident,” said Saathi Akter, a survivor. “I cannot express in words the enormity of this tragedy. I lost my husband in the incident. Nothing can be more heartbreaking than this,” said Momtaz Parveen, wife of Saeed Ahmed, who was an executive director of Phantom Apparels Ltd, one of the five factories housed in the plaza. Rokia Afzal Rahman, president of Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said she is ashamed of the catastrophe, which propelled Bangladesh into the headlines the world over for all the wrong reasons. Nazma Akter, president of Sammilito Garment Sramik Federation, said the catastrophe took place due to an error of a few, while citing the owners and some corrupt government officials as the culpable parties. She went on to urge the political leaders and garment owners not to exploit the poor garment workers anymore. “They should treat the workers as resources. The retailers and owners need to stop their greedy thinking.” The labour leader also criticised the Swedish retail giant H&M's Chief Executive Officer Karl-Johan Persson, who warned that the recent wage rise in the country could prompt many companies to shift orders to other countries. She said the salaries were hiked as per H&M's recommendations, while urging retailers to pay more for per unit of garment items from Bangladesh. “We need fair price and fair wage.”

Two US congressmen have written a letter to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina expressing dissatisfaction over Bangladesh's progress in a US-prescribed action plan for regaining GSP in the American market. In the letter sent on Wednesday, on the eve of the first anniversary of the Rana Plaza collapse, they called for improving working conditions in factories. The congressmen are Sander M Levin, ranking member of committee on ways and means, and George Miller, a senior democrat member of committee on education and the workforce. “We believe it is critical for the government of Bangladesh to take stronger steps to fully implement the action plan that was issued as a roadmap for reinstating trade benefits, which were suspended in June 2013 under the Generalised System of Preferences programme,” the letter said. The government has taken some steps but there has been insufficient progress in many areas, especially with regard to freedom of association, according to the letter. On registration of trade unions, they said registration of 141 trade unions over the last one year is a good job, but the US is "deeply concerned" about reports of harassment, mass firings, threats, and violence that the new union members have faced. “We understand that, at factory after factory, union leaders are forced by managers to sign blank sheets of paper that are later used to show that the union leaders are resigning or oppose union registration,” the letter said. If union leaders do not sign these blank sheets of paper, they are frequently threatened or beaten. “The physical attacks against workers reported at the Chunji Knit and Taratex facilities are only two examples of the pattern and practice of garment factory owners using threats and violence.” They urged the government to provide immediate and heightened attention to investigate these incidents and take necessary sanctions. On the issue of labour law reforms, they said although the amendment to the law is praiseworthy, recent reports on labour issues in Bangladesh raised a number of concerns regarding implementation. “The action plan requires Bangladesh to bring its EPZ laws into conformity with international standards,” the letter said. The congressmen also criticised the database on garment factories that was launched on March 30. “This database, however, is far from the tool outlined in the action plan. The database does not contain factory inspection results or descriptions of labour complaints against particular factories.” On the murder of labour leader Aminul Islam, they said the action plan requires the Bangladesh government to advance a transparent investigation into his murder. “The in absentia trial of Mustafizur Rahman is not satisfactory. We urge the government to reopen the investigation and ensure that a transparent and independent investigator is appointed,” the letter said. “We look forward to working with the government of Bangladesh to achieve full implementation of the action plan and continued and sustained progress with regard to workers' rights, as this will allow us to support the reinstatement of GSP benefits.”

Hundreds of thousands of people around the world yesterday mourned the garment workers who died in the Rana Plaza disaster one year ago. They also called upon retailers to be more transparent about their supply chains and compensate the victims and their families. In Paris, people wore funeral shrouds and held placards reading the names, age and profession of the victims as they took part in a protest marking the first anniversary of the Rana Plaza building collapse, reported AFP. In London, activists protested outside Gap's flagship High Street branch in Kensington over its refusal to join companies that have signed a legally binding Bangladesh Accord for Fire and Building Safety, following the disaster which killed 1,135, mostly garment workers. The protesters included comedian and writer Mark Thomas, representatives from the charity War on Want, and Tansy E Hoskins, the journalist who has written the new book Stitched Up: The Anti-Capitalist Book of Fashion. Nadia Idle, a campaigner of London-based rights organisation War on Want, demonstrated outside Gap's store in Kensington with a placard that says "Warning: Lethal Working Conditions. At lunchtime in London, activists, including fashion designer Katherine Hamnett, formed a human chain outside Gap's flagship Oxford Street branch, according to War on Want. Gap is one of the largest buyers of clothing items from Bangladesh. At Paddington in Central London, a Benetton store was closed after a protest in front of the store, according to a photo uploaded by Hannah Vickers on her Tweeter account. A world premiere screening of 'Tears in the Fabric', a film by the Rainbow Collective and supported by War on Want, was to be held in the evening in Tuke Hall at Regents University, according to the website of War on Want. Several labour groups, including the AFL-CIO, International Labour Rights Forum and United Students Against Sweatshops, were to gather outside the Children's Place, an American retailer, in Columbia Heights in Washington at 5:30pm. Global labour and rights groups marked the day by criticising the western retailers linked to the disaster, which include Spanish brand Mango, Italian brand Benetton and French retailer Auchan. Alongside forming a human chain on Oxford Street, the Unison union called on members to observe a minute's silence at 11.38am, while ethical fashion industry players are backing a Fashion Revolution Day. Campaigners believe the international response to the incident has been underwhelming, with a compensation fund for victims of the disaster remaining less than half full. Of the 29 western brands who sourced clothes from Rana Plaza factories, about half have deposited $15 million into the Rana Plaza Trust Fund against the targeted $40 million despite efforts of the International Labour Organisation, the Clean Clothes Campaign said. "We urge all the brands that have been working in Bangladesh to contribute to the fund with a considerable sum. They share a collective responsibility for this profoundly unsustainable production model and its hazards, this model that we are now about to change," said Jyrki Raina, general secretary of IndustriALL. UK International Development Minister Alan Duncan has called on British businesses to act as a "force for good" in Bangladesh. He said: "One year on, we all need to ask ourselves if we are doing everything we can, and this includes British businesses." "They have the power to bring about profound and positive change, whether by paying into the compensation fund or making their supply chain even more transparent," a Guardian article quoted the minister as saying.

As the world commemorates the one-year anniversary of the deadly Rana Plaza factory building collapse in Bangladesh, an overriding question remains: What can be done to prevent such industrial accidents in the future, especially in emerging economies and business sectors like Bangladesh's garment industry? Many European and North American retailers, who depend on the Bangladeshi textile industry for their apparel, have responded to the factory collapse with their own worker safety initiatives. There have also been calls for consumers to consider the human cost behind that bargain-priced clothing we all demand. At the same time, the media has picked up on the parallels between Rana Plaza and a similar disaster, a century earlier in New York City, when 146 people, mostly young immigrant women, were burned to death or forced to jump to their deaths after a fire swept through the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory. That 1911 tragedy gave new momentum to the US labour movement; it also introduced regulations and reforms for workplace conditions and safety. But will Rana Plaza serve as a turning point for garment industry workers or another missed opportunity? "I think that this disaster was big enough proportions that it caught the attention of the world in the way that perhaps some of the smaller incidents of the past have not," said Douglas Allen, director of the international MBA programme at the University of Denver's Daniels College of Business. "I know that it's come up in conversations I've had with some of my MBA students in China as well." There could be another incentive for change: profit. Some investors think Rana Plaza has opened the door to investment opportunities that can also improve safety and working conditions for garment workers in Bangladesh. "It's not about altruism, it's about money," said Benjamin Skinner, co-founder and senior vice president at Tau Investment Management. The New York venture investment firm believes that global supply chains have reached a critical point. "Decades of outsourcing and offshoring have reduced costs for leading corporations," it notes on its website, "but have also brought calamitous risks and inefficiencies." And what Tau characterises as a "race to the bottom" -- the cost-cutting and focus on productivity and profit ahead of investment in employee training, safety and well-being -- has led to tragedies like Rana Plaza, according to the firm. Part of the problem, Skinner said, is what he calls "short-termism" at the factory and retail levels. Bangladeshi apparel manufacturers "are looking at 60-to-90-day lead times, [with] extraordinarily, razor-thin margins," he said. In a country like Bangladesh, with its high interest rates on business loans, factory owners are more likely to invest in something that cuts down on their lead times, like a new machine, rather than in safety upgrades or new equipment. "The way these supply chains are run is just not efficient; it's just not good business," said Oliver Niedermaier, Tau Investment's chairman and CEO. "Whoever can provide capital and expertise and access to buyers, and really fixes the problems in global supply chains, will have a huge value creation opportunity -- and therefore it is a very good area to invest." Niedermaier gives the example of how such investment, combined with the willingness of a hypothetical Bangladeshi factory's majority owners and management, could transform a work environment. "We're going to buy new machinery, new sewing machines," he imagined. "We're going to realise equal efficiencies by putting in a new boiler system and reducing water consumption; upgrade the management team, inject a middle management layer. We're going to help you train your workers on these new sewing machines, we're going to source more raw materials, we build a proper child care facility." Changes like these create more efficient and conscientious companies, he said. But initiating that process across an entire industry is far from easy, and involves bridging daunting cultural and economic challenges to the way business has been done in the past. But in the long-term, Skinner noted, that effort is "about simplifying your sourcing, going to those vendors that are going to be reliable, where the lead times are going to be as promised, where the quality is extremely consistent and where the cost is eminently fair - - to the point we don't believe that you have to raise costs significantly to the buyer in order to have the products that are all of the above."

The insurance regulator has fined Republic Insurance Company Tk 2.5 lakh for doing business in credit. The Insurance Development and Regulatory Authority has settled a claim of nearly Tk 3 lakh for a client of Nitol Insurance, IDRA said in a statement yesterday. IDRA Chairman Shefaque Ahmed led the hearings attended by members of IDRA and chief executive officers of the insurance companies. Four branches, two in Dhaka and two in Chittagong and Bogra, of Republic Insurance were fined a total of Tk 2.5 lakh for doing business in credit violating insurance rules. In another hearing, IDRA asked Nitol to settle claims of Rangdhanu Enterprise in Chittagong worth Tk 2.85 lakh. A fire accident in 2012 caused Rangdhanu Enterprise a loss of Tk 2.85 lakh, but the insurer had dismissed the claim, saying that the client used substandard materials in building its warehouse. After hearings, IDRA found the claim acceptable and asked the insurer to pay the claim. IDRA warned the chief executives and branch managers of these companies against violating rules. Though the government enacted a new insurance law in 2010 and gave the authorities adequate control over the errant insurers, the regulator is yet to get sufficient employees to monitor activities of more than 70 companies. Cashing in on the weaknesses of the authorities, errant insurers have been violating tariff rates, paying illegal commission to clients and making transactions in cash and credit instead of commission.

The country's mobile phone operators want waivers on SIM taxes and value-added taxes on their services to boost internet dispersion. The Association of Mobile Telecom Operators of Bangladesh (AMTOB) placed their budget proposal at a pre-budget meet with the National Board of Revenue yesterday. The SIM tax waiver is the most important, as it emerges as the biggest obstacle to mobile operators, said TIM Nurul Kabir, secretary general of AMTOB. Currently, the operators pay Tk 300 for each SIM connection sold. If SIM taxes become zero by 2015, tele-density will increase to 85 percent from 72 percent at present, AMTOB predicts. The government could see a 2 to 4 percent jump in economic growth if more people have access to mobile services and 3G internet, the AMTOB proposal said. The country can reach its digitisation goal even before 2021 if data use increases, as the internet is going to be the key driver, Kabir said. The gross domestic product will increase by 0.15 percent if only 10 percent of 2G or voice subscribers are shifted to data or 3G services, said AMTOB. AMTOB also called for tax exemption on the import of internet modems and other equipment for the industry, along with a cut in corporate taxes applicable on the mobile service providers.

Wata Chemicals seeks to relist its shares on the Dhaka Stock Exchange, which transferred the company to over-the-counter market four and a half years back. The chemicals company filed an appeal after it became regularised in holding annual general meetings and paying dividends to its shareholders, according to the premier bourse. Wata Chemicals was transferred in 2009 to the bourse's OTC market, a separate trading floor for trading of junk shares. The OTC market is meant for those companies that are not in operation or fail to hold AGMs or declare dividends or do not convert their paper shares into electronic ones. Presently, 68 companies, including Wata Chemicals, are enlisted on the OTC market of the DSE. This is the third time Wata Chemicals, which was listed on the stockmarket in 1992, sought to come back to the main market. “The issue will be placed in the board meeting for taking decision on relisting of Wata Chemicals' shares,” said a top DSE official. The company has been holding AGM regularly and paying dividends to the shareholders a year after its delisting from the main market. It disbursed 20 percent stock dividends in 2012, 12 percent cash dividends in 2011 and 10 percent cash dividends in 2010. The majority of the paper shares, 88.97 percent, have been converted into e-shares, Wata Chemicals said in a letter to the DSE. The company's net profit rose about 64 percent year-on-year to Tk 2 crore in 2012.

Canada's Canpotex Ltd will supply potash worth up to $60 million to Bangladesh, said Ed Fast, Canadian minister for international trade, yesterday, according to a statement from the Canadian Embassy. An agreement was signed between Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC) and Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC) that assures the supply of potash worth $40 million, with a scope for additional supply worth a further $20 million. Martin Zablocki, president and chief executive of CCC, and Md Zahir Uddin Ahmed, chairman of BADC, signed the contract. The potash will be mined from Canpotex members' mines and will be delivered to Bangladesh over the coming year, as facilitated by CCC, the Canadian government's international government-to-government contracting organisation. “Our government will continue to support our exporters by creating jobs and opportunities as part of the most ambitious pro-trade, pro-export plan in Canada's history,” Fast said. “When our businesses succeed abroad, all Canadians benefit from the jobs and opportunities that are created at home.”  “I'm proud that Canadian potash will be used to help farmers in Bangladesh grow their crops. This is a major accomplishment for Saskatchewan's important potash sector, one that will continue to build the province's economy into the future,” said Gerry Ritz, Canada's minister for agriculture and agri-food said, according to the statement. The deal will increase bilateral trade between Canada and Bangladesh, which should hit the $2 billion mark by next year, said Heather Cruden, Canadian high commissioner to Bangladesh. “The sale of potash will also help national food security of Bangladesh by importing high quality potash,” she said. Given the high quality of Canadian potash, Cruden expressed confidence that Canada's share will grow to at least a third of the potash import demand of Bangladesh. Canada is one of the world's largest producers of potash, accounting for 30 percent of global production. In 2013, Canada exported $5.8 billion worth of potash to the world. Canada has 46 percent of the world's potash reserves primarily beneath the southern plains of the Saskatchewan province. Canada Bangladesh trade reached $1.85 billion last year with a positive trade balance for Bangladesh. Bangladesh mainly exports readymade garment. Canada exports wheat, lentils, various types of seeds, edible oil and base metals, the statement added.

The government has made a climate fiscal framework (CFF) to ensure transparency and accountability of climate-related public expenditure. The Finance Division and UNDP jointly organised a workshop on the CFF at a local hotel on Wednesday where State Minister for Finance MA Mannan was the chief guest. A planning ministry report revealed that 6-7 percent of the budget is used for activities related to climate change through different funding modalities, and an institutional framework is required for proper and effective utilisation of this expenditure. CFF has been formulated in this context with two major objectives: to track all climate-related expenditures incurred by the government at the present time and to estimate potential costs of long-term finance needs to combat harmful effects of climate change, the finance division said. The recommendations once implemented are expected to help integrate all climate sensitive expenditures into the national budget. It will also help in risk assessment, adaptation and mitigation. Shamsul Alam, member of the General Economics Division of the Planning Commission; Pauline Tamesis, country director of UNDP Bangladesh; and Fazle Kabir, secretary to the Finance Division,  were also present.

Dutch food and cosmetics giant Unilever on Thursday posted a first-quarter drop in sales down 6.3 percent which it blamed on unfavourable currency exchange rates. Turnover totalled 11.4 billion euros ($15.7 billion), weighed down by a negative currency impact of 8.9 percent, the Rotterdam-based group said in a statement. Despite lower sales, Unilever said underlying growth was strong, even in emerging markets where the group has been focusing its business in recent years. "Emerging markets are currently passing through a period of slower demand and volatility, but our strategy remains unchanged," Unilever chief executive Paul Polman said in the statement. Emerging markets underlying sales climbed by 6.6 percent year-on-year to 6.44 billion euros, while it fell by 0.3 percent to 4.96 billion euros in developed markets such as Europe. The Rotterdam-based group has invested massively in developing markets to compensate for the crisis in Europe and the United States, with developing markets now accounting for more than half of sales. Unilever however did not publish profits for the first quarter. It will do so for the half-year-results. Founded in 1930, Unilever is one of the world's leading suppliers of consumer goods and owns a variety of brands such as Lipton Yellow Label tea, Magnum ice cream, Knorr, Omo washing powder, Vaseline and Dove. It employs over 173,000 people worldwide.

No event in recent memory has drawn so much attention to Bangladesh from all corners of the world as did the collapse of the Rana Plaza building -- the worst disaster in the garment industry history -- on this day last year. The haunting images of the despondent rubble of the unauthorised eight-storey building brought out a public outrage against the 'Made in Bangladesh' label, not seen before in the Western world. The indignation though switched the government, garment factory owners and international retailers in to a pause for thought. Now, everyone is convinced that business cannot go on as before and the poor workers cannot continue to jeopardise their lives and wellbeing any longer -- for the sake of lining the pockets of factory owners and retailers. Indeed, they have taken some constructive steps, all with the eye to ensuring that another catastrophic collapse or fire never takes place again. First off was the inspection drive undertaken by the government and Western retailers to check the plants for structural and fire safety. The exercise started in November last year, and so far 900 factories have been examined. While small faults were found in all the buildings, only 13 factories were found to be unsafe for operation. An additional step was undertaken to ensure that workers have the voice to reject unsafe working conditions: the labour law was amended in July last year to give workers the right to freely associate in factories, among others. As of today, some 141 new trade unions have registered with the ministry of labour. To safeguard the wellbeing of workers, minimum wage was increased 77 percent to Tk 5,300 in December last year. While it fell short of workers' expectations, factory owners insist it is the threshold for the sustainability of their businesses. On the flipside, Bangladesh still remains the cheapest source of labour in the world, a massive comparative advantage over its competitors. The government is also reorganising its capacity through empowering the Fire Service and Civil Defence to develop skills and technical expertise to deal with fire, electrical and structural safety issues.
All very well, but when it comes to compensation for the misfortunate Rana Plaza victims that all parties were found badly wanting: none of the Rana Plaza's victims have received the full amount of compensation they were promised, one year on. While the government provided some financial support, the conduct of 14 of the 29 retailers that sourced from the five factories housed at Rana Plaza has been downright woeful. IndustriALL, a global union federation, initiated the Rana Plaza Trust Fund to justly compensate the victims, for which a total of $40 million is needed. All the 29 retailers that sourced from the Rana Plaza factories are bound to contribute to the fund, but 14 have refused to do so. Other retailers, too, have been asked to underwrite the fund chaired by the International Labour Organisation, but a major part of North American retailers did not express any willingness to participate. British retailer Primark has been the biggest contributor, putting in a total of $12 million for the victims. The other 14 firms have pledged to make donations at some point to the trust fund, which has so far collected $15 million. The exigency of compensation becomes all the more desperate when one takes a look at the inhumane lives that many of the survivors are leading as a result of the accident. Some of the injured have become permanently disabled, turning the once breadwinners of the families to suddenly become dependents or, in practical terms, burden for their poor families. These families should be bestowed the means to stop them for falling into the trap of abject poverty -- a thing they were trying to negotiate with on a daily basis in the first place with their incomes from the cut-sew-trim business.    But what is criminally unfortunate about the tragedy is although 1,135 lives perished, nobody was put behind bars for allowing the illegal structure to be constructed, factories to be set up in the illegal building and forcing workers to join work even when it became evident that the disaster was looming large. Going forward, the government will have to make negligence and indifference costly so that nobody ever fails to perform their duties to ensure a safe workplace -- and avert it from becoming a death trap.

The Centre for Policy Dialogue yesterday suggested the government establish a national commission with strong executive authority to solve the problems affecting the Rana Plaza victims and the garment sector as a whole. Rehman Sobhan, chairman of the local think-tank, said the commission would be headed by a high-powered person with other responsible people from within and outside the government, particularly from the civil society. “The commission will have full executive authority and not just oversight responsibility. It will discharge duties on a full-time basis,” he said during a dialogue on the Rana Plaza tragedy, at the Brac Centre Inn in Dhaka. Sobhan said the victims would be able to contact the commission to inform about their problems. “The commission will immediately act to solve the problem.” The noted economist also said the commission would take steps for the better of the entire garment industry. Sobhan also said there should be full transparency and accountability about the funds being mobilised in the name of Rana Plaza victims from both domestic and international sources. He urged the civil society to ensure that the voices of workers are heard if the government fails to deliver on its responsibilities. The government will also need to work on the institutional conditions which created Rana Plaza, Sobhan said. “This would be our expectation from a democratic and accountable government committed to good governance and addressing the people who have made Bangladesh a highly competitive country in the global garment trade.”
Mustafizur Rahman, executive director of CPD, said the government would have to see whether April 24 could be declared Workers' Safety Day. The government could also think of building a memorial at the site of Rana Plaza to honour the victims and a Workers' Safety Centre where workers will be able to get information, he added. Shirin Akhter, a lawmaker and labour activist, said the situation might have panned out differently if trade unions had been in the factories at Rana Plaza. “The union leaders would definitely protest the forced entry.” She said the country would have to make a long-term strategy for the welfare of the victims, so that the injured and the families of the dead workers do not feel that their sacrifices were worthless. One participant also called for providing a card to survivors that will enable them to get free treatment in government hospitals. Participants also called for a permanent centre where they will be able to lodge complaints. They said long-term treatment should be ensured for the injured, rescuers and volunteers, who are now finding it difficult to lead a normal life. KG Moazzem, additional research director of CPD, said the government should upgrade the capacity of the labour ministry and the Fire Service and Civil Defence so that they can take on disasters like Rana Plaza collapse.

The relationship between factory management and workers has improved tremendously since the Rana Plaza building collapse on April 24 last year, according to an official of International Labour Organisation. “The registration of 134 trade unions in the last 15 months, compared to only three in the last three years, indicates that the relationship has started improving,” Srinivasa Reddy, the ILO country director for Bangladesh, said in an interview with The Daily Star recently. He said the relationship between the government, owners, and workers should be used as a partnership, as Bangladesh has a lot of opportunities in the garment business worldwide. Following the Rana Plaza building collapse, the entire sector is going through broad reforms; many modifications have been made by the government, international communities and owners, Reddy said. “I see a great opportunity and bigger business for Bangladesh in near future. I also see good progress in factory inspection by Buet (Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology), Accord and Alliance.” A total of 900 factories, or 25 percent of the total active units, have so far been inspected, according to ILO data. “Owners have also started factory renovations, for which one million out of around four million workers are getting a safer workplace. Gradually, with completion of the inspection by the yearend, all the four million workers will have safer workplace,” Reddy said. Regarding the inspections, he said flaws may be found in some factories, but remediation is a kind of investment for future business. Referring to a survey by McKinsey & Company, a global management consulting firm and trusted adviser to leading global businesses, governments and institutions, Reddy said Bangladesh's high growth in the apparel sector will continue for positive reforms.  
The McKinsey report said Bangladesh will be able to export garment items worth $42 billion by the end of 2020. “Had there been a proper collective bargaining system in the country's garment sector, the Rana Plaza tragedy might not have taken place as the union leaders would have protected the workers and stopped them from entering a risky workplace.” On the issue of compensation packages for the victims of Rana Plaza, Reddy said payment will be ensured under Convention 121 of the ILO, so that the workers get more. The 29 retailers and brands that used to source garment items from the five factories housed in the Rana Plaza building should contribute to the trust fund for the victims, he said. So far, 15 retailers and brands deposited a total of $15 million in the trust fund. IndustriALL Global Union, a federation of trade unions, formed the $40 million trust fund for the victims. ILO is the fund's neutral chair. A central database of workers and factories is also needed now as the industry has been growing for the last three decades, Reddy said. “Had there been a central database for workers, compensation disbursement would not have been so complicated.” The most difficult job in the payment of compensation is collecting information on the victims to pay the right person. In the absence of a database, in some cases, more than one person by one name is claiming money from the authorities, Reddy added.

All but one of the 29 international retailers that sourced from factories housed at Rana Plaza are yet to donate any money to the trust fund for victims of the building collapse. So far, only $15 million has been collected in the trust fund managed by the International Labour Organisation against the required amount of $40 million. Of the 29 retailers, only British retailer Primark has put in $10 million. Roy Ramesh Chandra, general secretary of the local arm of IndustriALL, a global union federation, which initiated the trust fund to compensate the victims according to ILO Convention 121, said another 14 retailers have agreed to contribute to the trust fund but have not yet. As per ILO Convention 121, a dead worker's family is due to receive nearly Tk 29 lakh and each of the permanently disabled and injured workers Tk 42 lakh and Tk 14 lakh respectively. He said the ILO started giving out compensations from the trust fund yesterday; Tk 50,000 for each of the victims was dispatched in the first phase. In addition to the 29 retailers, IndustriALL also wrote to the 150 signatories of the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh for their benevolent contribution to the fund. “We will continue our campaign on both the domestic and international front until all retailers contribute to the fund.”
Chandra also said the amount disbursed to the victims from the Prime Minister's relief fund will not be merged with the trust fund. So far, a total of Tk 23.55 crore has been disbursed from the Prime Minister's fund. But, Mikail Shipar, secretary to the ministry of labour and employment, said the money that has been disbursed so far from the Prime Minister's relief fund will be considered as compensation money. “We do not have a plan for a separate compensation package,” he added. The highest compensation recommended by a national committee headed by MM Akash, an economics teacher at Dhaka University, is Tk 14.5 lakh.
