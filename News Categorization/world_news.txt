While the highest turnout of 83 per cent was recorded in the lone seat of Puducherry followed by West Bengal (82 per cent for six seats) and 73 per cent for all the 39 seats in Tamil Nadu which saw singled-phased polling on Thursday. Only two states — Rajasthan (59.2 per cent for five seats) and Maharashtra (55.33 per cent for 19 seats) — registered below 60% turnout. Jammu and Kashmir's Anantnag constituency, where PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti in in fray, recorded the lowest turnout of 28 per cent. An estimated average of 60 per cent of about 180 million voters exercised their franchise to decide the electoral fate of nearly 2100 candidates including political heavyweights like India' s Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid,  chief of Samajwadi Party Mulayam Singh Yadav and Indian President Pranab Mukherjee's son Abhijit. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh cast his vote along with his wife Gursharan Kaur and he told the media, "I don't think our country is struck by Modi wave. It is a creation of the media. Congress is not losing ground. We will win with a majority."  
After yesterday's polling the voting to 347 of the total of 543 Lok Sabha seats were over, with 216 seats left in the remaining three of the total of nine phases of the elections. Polling for the final phase covering 41 seats will be held on May 12 before votes are counted four days later. Yesterday's was the second biggest phase of the staggered elections — after the fourth phase held on April 17 covered 121 seats — stretching to the country's Jammu and Kashmir state in the north, Assam in the east and Maharashtra in the west besides Tamil Nadu in the southern tip.    The sixth phase also covered 12 of the 80 seats in the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh, 10 in Madhya Pradesh and seven in Bihar, apart from a handful in West Bengal, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh states. Politically the most important part of yesterday's polling was the 39 parliamentary seats in Tamil Nadu where BJP and a cluster of smaller regional parties have firmed up a rainbow alliance which is projected by opinion polls as having a realistic chance of bagging six to seven seats. If BJP and its allies manage to pick up the seats in Tamil Nadu, it will challenge the traditional view that no national party can survive in the state without the help of either DMK or AIADMK.   The 19 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra, including India's financial and entertainment capital  Mumbai, are crucial as the state's ruling Congress-Nationalist Congress Party alliance is projected to be struggling in the state which has a total of  48 seats. Mumbai city has six parliamentary seats all of which had been won by Congress in 2009. Stakes are high for BJP in the 12 constituencies that went to poll in Uttar Pradesh as the party had been decimated there five years ago. Narendra Modi campaigned hard in the state where opinion polls projected BJP to be making good gains this time. In the seven seats decided in Bihar, the challenge for BJP will be to retain four of them where there is a sizable Muslim population and the party faces a resurgent Rashtriya Janata Dal headed by Lalu Prasad Yadav. Voting has been completed in Assam's six seats, Chhattisgarh's seven and Jharkhand's four with yesterday's polling. Of the six seats in West Bengal, Pranab Mukherjee's son is reported to be fighting an uphill battle to hold on. A total of 819 million adults are eligible to vote in the ongoing multi-phase election.

A large number candidates trying their luck in the polling slated for the sixth phase yesterday, have sinister records. Nearly 15% face some kind of a criminal case, according to the Association for Democratic Reforms, which went through their disclosures. Nearly 10% face grave charges such as murder, arson and rioting. Most parties have shown no qualms about fielding candidates with criminal records. In the sixth phase, nearly 32% or 30 out of 94 candidates from the Congress have declared cases against them, followed by 26% or 20 out of 77 from the BJP.  Findings from ADR show a candidate with a criminal case is twice as likely to win an election (23%), compared to a candidate without any charges, whose winning chance was just 12%.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was set to make gains in two big states in the south and east that voted yesterday in the sixth phase of a mammoth general election that could help it build a stable majority in parliament. A final set of opinion polls predicted a strong showing by the BJP and its allies in Tamil Nadu in the south and West Bengal in the east that could make it less dependent on the two women who rule those states and who have in the past proved to be fickle coalition partners. The Hindu nationalist-led opposition, led by prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, is riding a wave of public anger across India against the ruling Congress party over a slew of corruption scandals and a slowing economy. His party is looking to make a dent in the south and east to pull off an outright majority, something that no party has been able to achieve in nearly two decades. "This election we are expecting a significant contribution from the south," said former BJP president Venkaiah Naidu, adding that the party wanted to lift its southern tally to 50 seats from 19 in the last election in 2009. A regional party led by Jayaram Jayalalitha, the powerful chief minister of Tamil Nadu, is expected to win the most seats, but not enough to sweep the state . In West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee's party is expected to win the most seats at stake in the state. Both Jayalalitha and Mamata are seen as belonging to parties to which Modi could turn in case he falls short of a majority in the national vote. However, both are likely to extract their pound of flesh. In Mamata's case, her left-leaning policies may run counter to Modi's reformist instincts.

Bharatiya Janata Party leader, frontrunner for the post of prime minister, yesterday joined the race for Lok Sabha, filing his nominations for the parliamentary seat in the Hindu holy town of Varanasi  at the district collector's office. Earlier, thousands of BJP workers and supporters, wearing saffron caps and Modi masks, swarmed the roads of Varanasi as an open truck, draped in BJP flag colours, carrying Modi travelled along the two two kilometre route of the roadshow that began at the campus of Banaras Hindu University    Modi's chief challengers in Varanasi constituency election is Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal, who filed his nomination on Wednesday, and Ajai Rai of Congress. Modi is also contesting for Vadodara parliamentary seat in his home state of Gujarat where he is chief minister. While filing his nomination, Kejriwal had attacked both Modi and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for spending huge amounts for their campaign and declared himself as a “fakir” with just Rs 500 in his pocket. But a mandatory affidavit filed by Kejriwal along with nomination papers presents an altogether different picture. According to it, he and his wife Sunita, a government employee, own properties worth nearly two crore.

Maoist rebels killed five police officers yesterday as they were returning from polling duty in an insurgency-hit region of eastern India, an official said. The attack took place in Jharkhand, one of 12 states where voters went to the polls in India's multi-phased general elections. "We can confirm that five of our brave men have died in the attack," head of Jharkhand police Rajeev Kumar told AFP. Over 12 people were also injured in the attack, which may have been triggered by a powerful landmine planted by the rebels, Kumar said. The Maoist rebels have called for a boycott of the elections that began on April 7. Results will be out on May 16, four days after polling ends. Earlier this month, the insurgents killed 14 people in two poll-related blasts in the central state of Chhattisgarh, underscoring the security challenges facing election organisers in India. Separatist and Maoist insurgencies occupy large swathes of India's northeast, northwest and central regions. The Maoists, described by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as the most serious internal security threat, have been fighting since 1967 for a communist society by toppling what they call India's "semi-colonial, semi-feudal" form of rule.

The Marshall Islands is suing the nine countries with nuclear weapons at the international court of justice at The Hague, arguing they have violated their legal obligation to disarm. In the unprecedented legal action, comprising nine separate cases brought before the ICJ yesterday, the Republic of the Marshall Islands accuses the nuclear weapons states of a "flagrant denial of human justice". It argues it is justified in taking the action because of the harm it suffered as a result of the nuclear arms race. The Pacific chain of islands, including Bikini Atoll and Enewetak, was the site of 67 nuclear tests from 1946 to 1958, including the "Bravo shot", a 15-megaton device equivalent to a thousand Hiroshima blasts, detonated in 1954. The Marshallese islanders say they have been suffering serious health and environmental effects ever since. The island republic is suing the five "established" nuclear weapons states recognised in the 1968 nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) – the US, Russia (which inherited the Soviet arsenal), China, France and the UK – as well as the three countries outside the NPT who have declared nuclear arsenals – India, Pakistan and North Korea, and the one undeclared nuclear weapons state, Israel. The NPT, which came into force in 1970 is essentially a compact between the non-weapon states, who pledged to not to acquire nuclear weapons, and the weapons states, who in return undertook to disarm under article VI of the treaty.

India and its South Asian neighbours are expected to see below-average to average rains this year if the El Nino weather pattern gains strength during the four-month monsoon season, a forum of weather experts said on Wednesday. Poor monsoons could dent crop output in India - the world's No.2 rice and sugar producer, while less rains in soybean areas could make the country, already the world's top importer of cooking oils, more dependent on overseas purchases. "There is a strong consensus about the possibility of evolution of an El Nino event during the summer monsoon season," said DS Pai, the lead forecaster of the Indian weather office, when releasing the consensus forecast of the South Asian Climate Outlook Forum - a group of global weather experts affiliated to the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). Rains could be below average in Sri Lanka, Bhutan, and some parts of Pakistan, while an average monsoon is expected in Bangladesh, Nepal and Afghanistan, Pai said. A strong El Nino, marked by a warming of the sea surface on the Pacific Ocean, can cause severe drought in Australia, Southeast Asia and India, while drenching other parts of the world such as the US Midwest and Brazil in rains. But it is a little early to assess the likely strength of El Nino, the WMO weather forum experts said. "El Nino is still in its neutral phase, not fully established, as it is yet to reach its threshold limit," said Rupa Kumar Kolli, head of the climate applications and service division of the WMO. A string of global agencies, including the Climate Prediction Centre, have forecast a high chance of El Nino arriving during the Northern Hemisphere summer this year. The WMO assessed earlier this month that an El Nino could develop around the middle of the year. This forecast followed predictions by other national forecasters, including weather bureaus in the United States, Japan and Australia, that an El Nino event was likely within months.

Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian yesterday accused Turkey of an "utter denial" in failing to recognise World War I mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as a genocide, after Ankara for the first time offered condolences for the tragedy. "The Armenian Genocide... is alive as far as the successor of the Ottoman Turkey continues its policy of utter denial," Sarkisian said in a statement marking the 99th anniversary of the massacres. "The denial of a crime constitutes the direct continuation of that very crime," he added. "Only recognition and condemnation can prevent the repetition of such crimes in the future." In an unprecedented move by a Turkish leader, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday offered condolences over the massacres, calling them "our shared pain." Armenians say up to 1.5 million people were killed during World War I as the Ottoman Empire was falling apart, a claim supported by several other countries. Turkey argues 300,000 to 500,000 Armenians and at least as many Turks died in civil strife when Armenians rose up against their Ottoman rulers siding with invading Russian troops.

US President Barack Obama yesterday vowed to defend Japan if China attacks over a tense territorial dispute, but also urged Beijing to step in to thwart North Korea's "dangerous" nuclear march. In Tokyo on the first leg of his Asian tour, Obama stopped short however of fully endorsing Japanese sovereignty over disputed East China Sea islands, keeping one eye on Beijing where his trip is being weighed for any hint of US hostility. Hopes that Obama's trip would revive the stalled Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) meanwhile looked doomed when there was little progress on one of the key sticking points -- US access to the Japanese auto market -- after his talks with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. After flying into a region boiling with tension, Obama carefully underlined US support for Japan's security, saying that islands at the centre of its feud with Beijing are covered by a defence treaty that would oblige Washington to act if they were attacked. "Article five (of the US-Japan security treaty) covers all territories under Japan's administration including (the) Senkaku islands," he said, referring to the archipelago which Beijing calls the Diaoyus. Along with Manila -- the fourth stop on Obama's tour -- Tokyo craved reassurance that Washington was prepared to support it if push comes to shove with Beijing over their separate sovereignty rows. Relations between Tokyo and Beijing are at their lowest point for years. Some observers warn they might come to blows over the islands, where ships from both sides lurk to press claims for ownership.

Pakistan fighter jets yesterday attacked Taliban hideouts in the lawless northwestern tribal belt and killed at least 37 suspected militants, officials said. It was the first time the military is known to have used air strikes on militants since the Pakistani Taliban announced a ceasefire on March 1 to help peace talks. The Taliban said last week it was ending the ceasefire, complaining of little progress in negotiations with the government. A series of militant attacks since then have killed seven people in the northwest. The airstrikes were staged in mountainous areas of the Khyber tribal district, where the Taliban and the banned militant group Lashkar-e-Islam (LeI) are active. LeI is feared for kidnappings and extortion in Khyber, one of seven lawless tribal districts along the Afghan border. Officials said ground troops also used heavy weapons to pound militant targets.

An Afghan policeman yesterday opened fire on staff at a Kabul hospital run by a US charity, killing three Americans in the latest deadly attack targeting foreign civilians in the city. The gunman was injured in the incident outside the CURE International hospital and detained by police, officials said, adding that the motive behind the shooting was not immediately known. "The attacker was a member of the police in the district," Seddiq Sediqqi, spokesman for the interior ministry, told AFP. "He opened fire as the foreign nationals were entering the hospital, tragically killing three and injuring one more. Another policeman in the area shot the attacker, injuring him." A medic who was treating the wounded told AFP that a foreign doctor was among the dead. Kabul has been hit by a spate of attacks targeting foreign civilians this year, including a Lebanese restaurant where 21 people died, an attack on a luxury hotel and the daylight shooting of a Swedish radio journalist. Last month Taliban militants attacked a Kabul guesthouse used by Roots of Peace, a US anti-landmine charity, killing two people including a girl. And this month Associated Press (AP) photographer Anja Niedringhaus was shot dead by a police commander in the eastern province of Khost in an attack which also left her Canadian colleague Kathy Gannon badly wounded. That killing came on the eve of presidential elections to choose a successor to Hamid Karzai as US-led combat troops withdraw from Afghanistan after 13 years of fighting Taliban insurgents.

Ukraine's military launched assaults to retake rebel-held eastern towns yesterday in which up to five people were reported killed, a move Russian President Vladimir Putin warned would have "consequences". The offensive sent international tensions soaring and oil prices up on the prospect of Russia making good on its threat of a massive response in the ex-Soviet republic. In Slavyansk, a flashpoint eastern Ukrainian town held by rebels since mid-April, armoured military vehicles drove past an abandoned roadblock in flames to take up position. Shots were heard as a helicopter flew overhead, and the pro-Kremlin rebels ordered all civilians out of the town hall to take up defensive positions inside. "During the clashes, up to five terrorists were eliminated," and three checkpoints destroyed, the interior ministry said in a statement. Hours later, the armoured vehicles withdrew, leaving the town calm but tense. The rebels, which the Kiev government and its Western backers believe are controlled and supported by Moscow, have been occupying around 10 towns in Ukraine's east since mid-April. It was the worst violence to erupt in Ukraine since the signing the Geneva accord a week ago. A brief truce collapsed over the weekend, prompting Ukraine's acting President Oleksandr Turchynov to order a resumption of an "anti-terrorist" offensive to flush the militants out. Putin called the armed offensive a crime.
"If Kiev has really begun to use the army against the country's population... that is a very serious crime against its own people," he said. He warned of "consequences, including for our intergovernmental relations". Russia, which has an estimated 40,000 troops massed on Ukraine's border, has already threatened to respond as it did when it invaded Georgia in 2008 if it sees its interests in Ukraine attacked. Shortly after Putin spoke, Russia's defence ministry announced new military "exercises" near the border in response to the Ukrainian military operations. US President Barack Obama yesterday accused Russia of not abiding by the Geneva deal and warned more sanctions could be imposed on Moscow within days.

A suicide bomber blew himself up near a local police official, killing four people and wounding 15 others in Pakistan's port city of Karachi yesterday, police said. The explosion took place near a tailor's shop in the old vegetable market in a neighbourhood to the east of the city. Nobody has so far claimed responsibility for the latest bomb attack but the city is also wracked by militants, especially the Taliban.

Former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah retained a clear lead in the latest Afghan presidential election results released yesterday, but he remained below the threshold needed for a decisive first-round victory. Abdullah has secured 43.8 percent of the vote, with his main rival Ashraf Ghani on 32.9 percent, election officials said, after about 80 percent of ballots were counted.
