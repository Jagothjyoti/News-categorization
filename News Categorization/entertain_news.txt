It is a flagship enterprise within the fraternity, having witnessed the evolution and growth of art in the country. Established in 1974 by Ramij Ahmed Chowdhury Saju, the gallery was intimately acquainted with the artists of the first generation in the country. And the gallery also spawned many others, to be followed by generations after them. Young artists of the '60s and '70s, recognised as celebrated artists of today have all had their first solo shows at the gallery. The gallery caters to collectors of the paintings of masters, and investors; it also showcases works purely for aesthetic reasons for those with a deep and enduring passion for art. The gallery started an art exhibition, titled “Grand Group Art Exhibition”, in 1977 which has gradually become the biggest annual art show in this country. At this year's exhibition, masters, renowned as well as emerging artists are showcasing their works. About 127 artworks featuring 87 artists are on display at the exhibition. Artworks of Quamrul Hassan, SM Sultan, Safiuddin Ahmed, Aminul Islam, Murtaja Baseer, Syed Jahangir, Shamsul Islam Nizami, Samarjit Roy Chowdhury, Rafiqun Nabi, Monirul Islam and others add a distinct value to the collection of artworks on display.
Quamrul Hassan was recognised for retrieving our folk and traditional elements through his art. At the exhibition, his woodcut mingles romanticism with realism, focusing on strong curved lines, contours, and contrasted use of shade. As a self- taught painter, SM Sultan delved deep into rural life, especially fishermen, peasants, labourers and their simple lives. His two drawings are on display, where a dancing figure in one and a primitive face in the other have been highlighted. At 83, Murtaja Baseer has been critically ill recently, but his impressive drawing at the exhibition reveals his unparalleled creativity in the field of arts. The simple drawing articulates mingling of a woman's beauty with a mystic vibe. Monirul Islam always produces different genres of prints. However, over the years, he has focused more on painting. Currently, his application of paint is profound and the lines are more minimised; colours give the impression of being both quiet and vivacious. His “Lemon Rain” attracts with mellow base and subdued colours. Also on display are works of artists Abu Taher, Mahmudul Haque, Syed Abdullah Khalid, Abul Barq Alvi, Biren Shome, Abdus Shakoor, Kamal Kabir, Shahabuddin Ahmed, Ranjit Das, Mohammad Eunus, Kanak Chanpa Chakma, Mohammad Iqbal, Goutam Chakraborty, Anisuzzaman and others. As a painter, Biren Shome's growth has been slow and steady. Over the years, he immersed himself in semi and pure abstraction. At the exhibition, his painting on display delves deep into abstract expressionism. Flamboyant colours, both mellow and uneven textures as well as composition are the main features. Ranjit Das is a painter who focuses on time, life and various social, political and cultural issues. The artist has been consistently experimenting. His works appear to us with a novel appearance and contemplation on our existence. Kamal Kabir is an introverted painter who particularly concentrates on the underwater world. He subsumes himself deep in a world of tranquility. Fish are the predominant aspects of his works. His canvas is a space where rich texture and thick colours join into one another. Mohammad Eunus' “Composition” bears witness to the madness of current times in an eruption of vicious shades in different layers. The eruption of colours is accompanied by contrast, and the reality of texture is created in the abstract expression. Goutam is known for his miniature paintings. In search of perfection, he devotes much time to a single piece of work. The painter has distinguished himself as a remarkable artist, revealing his creativity by using alluring forms, subtle and subdued colours on canvases with refreshing and lyrical forms.His world of animals is rich in symbolic effects. It consists of cats, horses and elephants. Anisuzzaman, who is known almost exclusively for his delicate and intricately balanced woodcut prints of structures or construction materials, has recently been drawn to traditional boats of Bengal of various shapes and sizes. He loves to capture boats in close-ups. Jamal Ahmed, Ahmed Shamsudohha, Sheikh Afzal Hossain and Mohammad Muniruzzaman have great similarity in their mode of expression, particularly realism. Jamal Ahmed is presently the chairman of the Department of Drawing and Painting of the Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka. For a long time, Bengal's scenic beauty as well as nubile women in all their curvaceous beauty, bucolic panoramic view, metropolis, bauls, mendicants, working class and more have been supremely depicted by the realist painter. Ahmed Shamsudohha's photo-realism always captivates art enthusiasts. His “Sundarban” denotes the riverbank where some boats are scattered on the sand. Tranquil blue water of the river touching the bank and the image clearly demonstrates a sweet sunny day. Among the participating artists, Hamiduzzaman Khan, Abul Barq Alvi, Alokesh Ghosh, Chandra Shekher Dey, Farida Zaman, Gulshan Hossain, Samiran Chowdhury, Anukul Majumdar, Abdul Aziz and others are earnest painters in the Dhaka art scene and regularly exhibit their works at various galleries in the city. At the exhibition, a number of painters' intellectually driven works are also set to get a new look with the exposition. The artists include Swapan Chowdhury, Mizanur Rahim, Mostafizul Haque, Mokhlesur Rahman, Laila Sharmeen, Faruque Ahmed and others.

The Bangla New Year was marked, dividing the six seasons according to cultivation of crops for the convenience of toll collection by Mughal Emperor Akbar, with another tradition of Halkhata -- of businesses closing the old accounts ledgers and opening new ones through treating their customers to sweets and other delicacies. There is always that extra air of festivity surrounding Boishakh, and in that spirit, Star Melodies organised a gathering of musicians of repute, to embark on an evening of timeless melodies. Titled “Baul Batash”, the event was held on April 19 (Saturday) at the AS Mahmud Seminar Hall of The Daily Star Centre.
Artistes and audience were welcomed into a new-look auditorium -- with set, light and art direction by Selim SH Chowdhury, with pulsating beats of dhol by Doshoroth Dhuli, after Sadya Afreen Mallick, who compered the programme, welcomed the guests. Close-Up 1 champion of 2008, Liza was the first to perform, setting the mood with two timeless numbers, “Ami Rojonigondha Phul'er Moto” and “Jar Chhaya Porechhe” in her silky voice. As the audience swelled in numbers, Munir Chowdhury, Mofizul Huq, Kona, Abdullah Al Mamun, Sabbir and Bizon Chandra Mistry gave in performances thick and fast, only as if to condense the ambiance. Be it the ever-familiar “Neel Akash'er Niche Ami”, “O Nodi Re”, “Chena Chena Lage”, “E Shudhu Gaaner Din”, “Shobai Toh Shukhi Hote Chay” or the lesser-remembered but still blissfully melodious ones like “Ami Nijer Mone Nijei Jeno”, “Paharer Kanna Dekhe”. To bring in a little variation, Kona, who was originally a Nazrul Sangeet artiste before she switched focus to pop -- sang a Nazrul number “Megher'o Domoru Ghono Baaje”, while Bizon Chandra Mistry sang an Ajoy Chakrabarty song “Dokhina Batash Aji Bohey Mridumondo”.
With three accomplished musicians playing along -- Sunil Kumar Sarkar on keys, Sunil Chandra Das on violin and Bishwajit on tabla, the music seemingly oozed out and overflowed out of the auditorium, as members of The Daily Star family dropped in, some even standing at the back, unable to find seats. And it was not just them who were enjoying the music; nearly all the artistes sat through even after their performance, taking a stroll down memory lane with the songs. The inimitable Syed Badrul Ahsan (Executive Editor, The Daily Star) also took up the microphone in between performances, causing loud laughs among the audience with his witty remarks and quips. The musical performances, meanwhile, continued. Moumita Haq Sejuti, a first year college student, took the audience by surprise with her skillful rendition of SD Burman's “Ami Chhinu Eka” and a semi-classical number “Shankarkare Domoru Bajey”, while Nasima Shaheen Fancy and Nargis Chowdhury also sang beautiful songs like “Aj Tobe Etukui Thak”, Onek Brishti Jhorey” and “Sagorer Teer Theke”.
The three artistes to follow, however, took the evening to another level. Beauty put her expressive vocal range on display with two Lalon songs “Chatok Bache Kemone” and “Shob Loke Koy Lalon Ki Jaat”, along with “Amar Sona'r Moyna Pakhi” as Doshoroth Dhuli joined in, while Chandana Majumdar, with her usual smile on the face, effortlessly performed a Lalon number “Emon Manob Somaj” and an upbeat folk song “Tomra Na Jaiyo Jomuna'r Jole”. Kiron Chandra Roy discussed the early struggles of singing folk songs after Bangladesh's independence, and how the culture is sometimes misrepresented. He sang two self-written songs “Aul Baul Koro Tomra” and “Na Janiya Bhed Bidhan”, with the profound lyrics and his booming voice touching those in the crowd.
By then, Fahmida Nabi had also arrived, who performed her father Mahmudun Nabi's famous song “Tumi Kokhon Eshe Dariye Acho”, along with one verse each from a few of her own popular songs. Anupama Mukti was the last to take the stage, bringing a fitting close to the evening with two marvelous songs “Gaane Mor Kon Indrodhonu” and “Je Chhilo Drishty'r Simanaye”. The evening provided a refreshing change from the hustle and bustle of busy cosmopolitan life - of going back in time with the songs of yesteryears, and forgetting the scorching heat and unbearable traffic jams. Chandana Majumdar aptly said she would love for such events to be a regular occurrence, and not just as a performer, but as a listener too.

William Shakespeare would be four hundred and fifty years old, had he lived, on 23 April this year. When you reflect on him, you tend to focus not just on literature but on an entire range of philosophy as well. He does not just come back to you every April. He is, has always been, with us. And just how he has managed to do that comes through the everyday acts in life you go through. You watch the stars in the night, beside some rural pond in Bangladesh or somewhere in a bush deep in Africa. And you recall Hamlet: “There are more things on heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy, Horatio.” And there you have it, this acknowledgement of the huge mystery we call Creation. It is something that comes to us through the tranquil waters of faith. And Shakespeare evokes that call of faith, that sure sense of feeling involving the real and the imagined, or the shadow and the reality. You think of the ghost of Hamlet's father, of the truths that sometimes come revealed to men in their dreams or in their treks through deserted woodland paths. And you remember Shakespeare. William Shakespeare is our man for all seasons. He brings to his thoughts the broad compactness of the universe and then transfers that compactness of experience to us. His comedies are perhaps the places where the common, huddled masses come resplendent in their pedestrian gleam. Nick Bottom. There is little question he is a buffoon, but then, aren't we all buffoons of some degree or the other in life? And the young fairyland woman who falls for his charms? Call that the effect of blind love. And love must be blind. What is that memorable line from the Bard again? Ah! “Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind / And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind.” So true, so true. If you wish to be in love, shut your eyes and imagine the feminine object of your desire in all her diversity of beauty. You will love the levels of adrenalin coursing through your being. Macbeth loved his wife, even if it was, at a point, love induced by the lady's domineering tendencies. The proof? Well, he did go and try to kill Duncan, didn't he? And then there is Othello for you. He was a jealous man, a possessive husband. And he thought he was symbolic of masculinity. But make no mistake about it --- he loved Desdemona, for he could not imagine any other man passing on to her the priapic affections he so lavishly heaped on her. He did away with her life. The handkerchief is not important. Othello murders Desdemona. Browning, in later times, makes another envious lover kill Porphyria. Call it murderous love, call it whatever you will. It is there. You cannot run away from it. Shakespeare's women, at least most of them, happen to be challengingly intelligent. No, not Amazonians, but women like Kate who throw down the gauntlet before proud men and then end up being in fierce love with them. But if Kate is fire and fury, Portia is cool, collected and inclined to the reasonable. She makes a gash on her patently alluring thigh to demonstrate her spousal feelings for the brooding, doomed Brutus. You have a sure sense that if Portia and not Calpurnia were married to Caesar, the Roman dictator would be persuaded to stay home and not walk to his death in the senate. Tragedy would not happen. Often in Shakespeare, as also in the banality of life through the millennia, tragedy has been a straight offshoot of arrogance. Caesar believes he is constant as the north star. He is dismissive of the ides of March prediction, taunts the man who has served warning on him: “The ides of March are come.” The response is cool and deadly: “Ay, Caesar, but not gone.” In Caesar, you spot the human flaw which leaves scores of lives reduced to wrecks of dreams and ambitions. He understands the malignancy in Cassius: “Yon Cassius has a lean and hungry look. Such men are dangerous.” And yet he does not, will not smell the mischief already afoot. King Lear too will not see the brutish in his elder daughters' demeanour toward him. He pays a price, cradling the dead Cordelia in his arms and wondering why a rat, a horse, a dog will have life but his dear daughter none at all. In Shakespeare and through him, you wonder all the way. Even as the blossoms dance before you, you wallow in the winter of your discontent. You do not take kindly to the grasping Shylock, but when he comes close to you, breathes down your face in all his centuries-old fury, you understand his loneliness. “Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands . . .” The pain in him is asphyxiating, for you, as you hear him condemn his tormentors: “If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die . . . The villainy you teach me I will execute. It will go hard but I shall better the instruction.” It is Shylock's desperation and your resultant morbidity at play. Ah, the morbid! “Where's Polonius?” asks the king of the Prince of Denmark. “At supper,” answers the surly young man. “At supper?” wonders a worried monarch. And then comes the last word from Ophelia's lover: “Not where he eats, but where he is eaten.” (William Shakespeare, born in 1564, died in 1616).

The readymade garments industry of the country is massive; it contributes billions of dollars in foreign exchange to the country's reserves, employment for hundreds of thousands of people – particularly women, and has kept the country's economy afloat even at times of global economic turmoil. Yet, behind the clothes that end up on the hangers of major clothing brand showrooms across the world, are stories of despair, danger, neglect and indifference. Be it factory fires, building collapses, or inhumane treatment of labourers that -- when it breaks out as unrest is brutally dealt with, lives and livelihoods of those at the core of our garments industry are fascinatingly touching tales. Photojournalist Andrew Biraj is one of the most prominent contemporary names in the country's photography arena. With major global photography awards, including World Press Photo and National Geographic, and being published in Time.com, New York Times and International Herald Tribune, his works have been known to bring out vivid, in-depth stories of people. As a photographer of international news agency Reuters, Biraj has been a close follower of the events transpiring at our garments industry over the years, and his latest photography exhibition, “Bonded Stitches and Struggle”, is a powerful narrative on the life of garment workers. The exhibition, held in three parts – near the Savar Central Hospital, Drik Gallery in Dhanmondi and Chhobi'r Haat at Shahbagh – encompass a myriad of issues. Aptly timed at the one-year anniversary of the tragic Rana Plaza incident, the Savar chapter of the exhibit shows photos of one of the worst man-made disasters to have happened in recent history; the incident and the aftermath. Valerie Taylor, founder of Centre for Rehabilitation of the Paralysed (CRP) where many victims of Rana Plaza have been treated, and a humanitarian icon, opened the exhibition along with survivors of the collapse, on April 22. The Drik Gallery part of the exhibition – that opened yesterday – is possibly the most striking of them all. It's amazing how the photographer has touched so comprehensively on such a wide array of garments incidents – Rana Plaza, Spectrum, Hamim, Tazreen and Smart – in just 24 photos. Placed on thick, black frames, the photos – some placed on the ground while some remain on the wall –touch on the marginal lifestyle of garment workers, their helplessness, struggle against adversities, and the fight for their rights. The portraits are multi-layered, with masterly background setting and framing treatment, while the wider shots zoom out seamlessly to show the bigger picture. The opening ceremony was attended by Canadian High Commissioner Heather Cruden, Dutch Ambassador Gerben Sjoerd de Jong, economist Professor Anu Mohammad, noted photographers Taslima Akhter and Saiful Huq Omi, and environmental lawyer Syeda Rezwana Hasan. The Chhobi'r Haat display is also interesting: it's a seven-photo series on a single garment worker, who fought a rowdy bunch of policemen charging hard on garments workers in unrest. The display opens today. The exhibition ends on May 1.

Swagata is a household name on the small screen, besides being a model, anchor, actress and singer. In a recent conversation, the multi-faceted Swagata talked about her busy professional life:

It was “Icche Puron”, directed by Yusuf Hasan Ark.

I appear as a village girl in the play scripted and directed by Badrul Anam Soud. I had to learn the local dialect of Mymensingh to enact the role. The director and the entire team were very helpful in this regard. The drama, featuring a number of prominent artistes, was shot in Rajendrapur.

Here, I play a courageous character named Monisha who is a physician by profession. I thoroughly enjoyed acting in the critically acclaimed play.

There is “Swapan Korechhi Bapon”, directed by Syed Awlad. I have taken a fresh approach to this role.

Directed by Goutom Koiri, it is a story based on the life of four women corporates. I play one of them. In the project, the audience will see me in a new avatar.

In the next few days, I will be very busy shooting for several new serials. I am now working on “Annandamahal”, a story, based on the struggle of a 35-year-old woman who falls on hard days after her daughter's demise. I came face to face with hard reality when I was doing this role.  

I am emceeing a programme “Positive View” on ntv. It is targeting at those involved in underworld music. It will be telecast four times a month. As the audience love my anchoring, I want to emcee a few other select programmes. Overall, I prefer to emcee such music related programmes.

I am totally into music.

“Firey Esho Behula” I appeared in the film as a guest artiste.

It starts with a cup of tea that I enjoy with my father. When I return home late at night, I often find him sleeping in the drawing room, awaiting my arrival.

My father sometimes surprises me with a visit when I am near Dhaka on a shooting location for two or three days, A few days ago as I prepared for a shot, my father was at the location digging into a watermelon.

As a school girl, I aspired to be a pilot. Later, I thought of becoming a singer.

I got Taka 300 after an appearance as a child artiste in a BTV programme.
